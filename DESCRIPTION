Description: Create and maintain delayed-data packages (ddp's).  Data stored in
  a ddp are available on demand, but do not take up memory until requested.
  You attach a ddp with g.data.attach(), then read from it and assign to it in
  a manner similar to S-PLUS, except that you must run g.data.save() to
  actually commit to disk.
